**Regular Expression**



* Regular Expression work with strings

* Strings are sequeces of characters\(bytes\)

* Files are sequences of bytes too

* When you have sequences you also have a pattern.



DNA is a sequence of molecules \(A, C, T and G\).

* Genes are patterns of molecules.

Example of DNA Analysis: 

Pattern to search for: ATG 

Start from left, search each base until the pattern matches 

**G-T-C-A-T-C-A-T-G-T-T-C**



**Matching Patters **

With a pattern specified, new questions arise: 

Is this pattern found in DNA Sample? 

How many times does it occur?

At what position does it occur?

What genes comes immediately before and after?



**Patters: Exact vs. Inexact**

**Exact matches**: describes a literal string to match on \( find command in a text editor\).

**Inexact matches**: describes a pattern to match on. 

regular "expressions" are "super" cool.
