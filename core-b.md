# Project Management 

When it come to project management, as a developer most of the time you won't be working close to your team members, so it's very important that you are able to scope and plan the "story boards" and communicate with your team members. 

#### Steps:

* Make sure that every part of the project is very well scoped.
* Validate your resources. 
* Make sure that there a constant communication between your team mates. 
* Make sure that each team member has access to every code or source that is needed.
