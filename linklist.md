Efficiency of Linked List Operations 

| Operation | Singly-Linked List | Doubly-Linked List |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Access an element | O\(n\) | O\(n\) |
| Add/remove at an iterator position | O\(1\) | O\(1\) |
| Add/remove first element | O\(1\) | O\(1\) |
| add last element | O\(1\) | O\(1\) |
| Remove last element | O\(n\) | O\(1\) |



Array vs. Linked List

| Aspect | Array | Linked List |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Size |  Fixed number. Size need to be specific during declaration  | Grow and contract since of insertions and deletions. Maximum size depends on heap |
| Storage capacity | Static it's location is allocated during compile time | Dynamic. It's node is located during run time |
| Order and sorting  | Stored consecutively | Store randomly |
| Accessing the element | Direct or random access method. Specify the array index or subscript | Sequential access method. Traverse starting from the first node in the list by pointer |
| Searching  | Binary search and linear search | Linear search |
