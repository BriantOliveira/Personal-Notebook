## Neural-Networks

**What is a neuron? **

Neurons \(also called neurones or nerve cells\) are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from external world, for sending motor commands to our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between. 



**What does a neuron look like?**

A useful analogy is to think of a neuron as a tree. A neuron has three main parts: **dendrites**, an **axon** and a **cell body or soma**, which can be represented as the branches, roots and trunk of a tree, respectively. A dendrite \(tree branch\) is where a neuron receives input from other cells. Dendrite branch as they move towards their tips, just like tree branches do, and they even have leaf-like structures on them called spines.

The **axon \(tree roots\)** is the output structure of the neuron; when a neuron wants to talk to another neuron, it sends an electrical message called an action potential through the entire axon. The **soma \(tree trunk\)** is where the _**nucleus lies**_, where the neuron's DNA is housed, and where proteins are made to be transported throughout the **axon and dendrites**.

**Dendrite - **The receiving part of the neuron. Dendrites receive synaptic inputs from axons, with the sum total of dendritic inputs determining whether the neuron will fire an action potential. 

**Spine - **The small protrusions found on dendrites that are, for many synapses, the postsynaptic contact site. 

**Action potential** - Brief electrical event typically generated in the axon that signals the neuron as 'active'. An action potential travels the length of the axon and causes release of neurotransmitter into the synapse. The action potential and consequent transmitter release allow the neuron to communicate with other neurons.
