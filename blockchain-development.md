**Transparent and incorruptible -**

The blockchain network lives in a state of consensus, one that automatically checks in with itself every ten minutes.  A kind of self-auditing ecosystem of a digital value, the network reconciles every transaction that happens in ten-minute intervals. Each group of these transactions is referred to as a “block”. Two important properties result from this:

1. **Transparency **
   data is embedded within the network as a whole, by definition it is public.
2. **It cannot be corrupted **
   altering any unit of information on the blockchain would mean using a huge amount of computing power to override the entire network.
