**4K - **Taking a step back: Standard definition \(SD\), high definition \(HD\), and 4K \(or Ultra HD\) refer to a characteristic called resolution, or the number of pixels \(or tiny display bits\) that make up a display.

A common HDTV has a resolution of 1080p. In simple terms, it's 1,920 x 1,080 pixels: 1,920 pixels going across the display horizontally, and 1,080 pixels going across it vertically.

A 4K TV simply boosts that pixel count: Usually, 4K refers to a display resolution of 2160p, or 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. That's roughly four times larger than a 1080p picture, hence the term "4K."

\(Technically, 4K isn't the same as 2160p, but the technical differences are so minor that it doesn't really matter.\)
