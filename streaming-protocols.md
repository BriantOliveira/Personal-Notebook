### **4K & HDR**

Taking a step back: Standard definition \(SD\), high definition \(HD\), and 4K \(or Ultra HD\) refer to a characteristic called resolution, or the number of pixels \(or tiny display bits\) that make up a display.

A common HDTV has a resolution of 1080p. In simple terms, it's 1,920 x 1,080 pixels: 1,920 pixels going across the display horizontally, and 1,080 pixels going across it vertically.

**A 4K TV simply boosts that pixel count: Usually, 4K refers to a display resolution of 2160p, or 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. That's roughly four times larger than a 1080p picture, hence the term "4K**."

\(Technically, 4K isn't the same as 2160p, but the technical differences are so minor that it doesn't really matter.\)

4K may not be all that, but 4K TVs do have one important feature that makes it worth the purchase:** high-dynamic range, or HDR.**

**HDR boosts a display's contrast ratio, which is the difference between the brightest and darkest colors your TV can show. It allows for much finer detail in the shades in between those light and dark colors.**

HDR also usually comes with another feature, called **wide-color gamut \(WCG\)**, which lets a TV produce more colors than most displays are capable of.

_**The combination of 4K, HDR and WCG results in a picture that's more vivid and lifelike. Colors are less muted, and objects appear to have more depth. It's not a gimmick, but a real improvement to picture quality.**_

The big issue with HDR is the same issue with 4K: You need content shot in that native format, and there isn't much of it. While that's changing, with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video getting into the game, HDR has still yet to go mainstream.

### **MPEG-DASH**

**Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, **also known as MPEG-DASH, is an adaptive bitrate streaming technique that enables high quality streaming of media content over the Internet delivered from conventional HTTP web servers. Similar to Apple's HTTP Live Streaming \(HLS\) solution, MPEG-DASH works by breaking the content into a sequence of small HTTP-based file segments, each segment containing a short interval of playback time of content that is potentially many hours in duration, such as a movie or the live broadcast of a sports event.

MPEG-DASH is the first adaptive bit-rate HTTP-based streaming solution that is an international standard.

MPEG-DASH should not be confused with a transport protocol â€” the transport protocol that MPEG-DASH uses is TCP.

.MPEG-DASH uses existing HTTP web server infrastructure that is used for delivery of essentially all World Wide Web content. It allows devices like Internet-connected televisions, TV set-top boxes, desktop computers, smartphones, tablets, etc. to consume multimedia content \(video, TV, radio, etc.\) delivered via the Internet, coping with variable Internet receiving conditions. Standardizing an adaptive streaming solution is meant to provide confidence to the market that the solution can be adopted for universal deployment, compared to similar but more proprietary solutions like **Smooth Streaming by Microsoft, or HDS by Adobe.**

## Adaptive Bitrate Streaming

Is a technique used in streaming multimedia over computer networks.While in the past most video or audio streaming technologies utilized streaming protocols such as RTP with RSTP, today's adaptive streaming technologies are almost exclusively based on HTTP and designed to work efficiently over large distributed HTTP networks such as the internet.

**It works by detecting a user's bandwidth and CPU capacity in real time and adjusting the quality of the media stream accordingly.**

More specifically, and as the implementations in use today are, adaptive bitrate streaming is a method of video streaming over HTTP where the source content is encoded at multiple bit rates, then each of the different bit rate streams are segmented into small multi-second parts.
