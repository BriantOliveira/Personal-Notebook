Suppose you have a corpus with 50,000 words total \(2, 000 unique words\)

1\) If you build a histogram, how many entries will it have?

Only 2000 \(number of types\) , because the histogram will count the number of the occurrences.

Dictionary takes only unique values.

2\) If you build a 1st order Markov Chain what structues do you need to create and how many?

Two Dictionaries

{'Dictogram': \({ Dictogram }\) }

3\) If you build a 2nd order Markov chain, how many would you structures change? Approximately how many of these structures will you have?

Two Dictionary and a String {'String': {... : ... }}

Two Dictionary and a tuple {\(... , ....\){... : ... }}

String is a data type and not a structure. Structures are build off of data types.
