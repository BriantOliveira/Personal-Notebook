# Udacity - Statistics Data Science

##### Klout Data -

* Take all samaples of size 35.

* Find mean of each sample.

* Graph distribution of sample means \(sampling distribution\) .

##### Standard deviation -

A quantity calculated to indicate the extent of deviation for a group as a whole.

Standard error:

Population Standard deviation / the square root of n \(sample size\).

Margin of error - Two times the population standard deviation divided by the root n.

#### Measures of center

Mean

* has a simple equation \(the sum of X / n\). 
* The mean will also change if any data values changes. 
* The mean will not be affected by change in the bin size

~ QUIZ

~ Which of the following is true for the normal distributions?

* The mean, media, and more are all equal. 

~ If a positively skewed distribution has a median of 50, which of the following is true?

* The mean is greater than 50. 
* The mode is less than 50
* The median is greater than the mode, but less than the mean. 

~ Which of the following is true of the mean?

* For normal distributions, it is approximately equal to the median and mode.

~ Which of the follow is true of the mode?

* It is not affected by extreme score \(outliers\).
* For normal distributions, it is approximately equal to the mean and median. 
* It is the most frequently occurring score. 
* It can be used to describe categorical data, such as gender or country of origin. 

~ Which of the following is true of the median?

* It is the exact middle of any distribution \(half the data is less than the median, half is more\)
* It is nor affected by extreme scores\(outliners\).
* For normal distributions, it is approximately equal to the mean and mode.

**Outilier** &lt; Q1 - 1.5 \(IQR\)

Q3 + 1.5 \(IQR\)

**SS** \(Sum of squares\) = M \(xi - x\)

**Variance** -

* Mean of squared deviations
* Sum of squared deviations divided by n

**Standard deviation** -

* Square root of average squared deviation. 
* Square root of \(\(Sum of square deviations\) divided by n\).

A negative Z-Score means:

* The original value is less than the mean. 
* The original value minus the mean is negative. 

The z-score of any value, that's one standard deviation away from the mean, will then be 1 after we standardize it.



**Standard normal distribution **

When we have a normal distributions, we can standardize it by first subtracting the mean, shifting it to 0. And then dividing by the standard deviation, which makes the standard deviation 1.
