# Udacity - Statistics Data Science

##### Klout Data -

* Take all samaples of size 35.

* Find mean of each sample.

* Graph distribution of sample means \(sampling distribution\) .

##### Standard deviation -

A quantity calculated to indicate the extent of deviation for a group as a whole.

Standard error:

Population Standard deviation / the square root of n \(sample size\).

Margin of error - Two times the population standard deviation divided by the root n.

#### Measures of center

Mean

* has a simple equation \(the sum of X / n\). 
* The mean will also change if any data values changes. 
* The mean will not be affected by change in the bin size

~ QUIZ

~ Which of the following is true for the normal distributions?

* The mean, media, and more are all equal. 

~ If a positively skewed distribution has a median of 50, which of the following is true?

* The mean is greater than 50. 
* The mode is less than 50
* The median is greater than the mode, but less than the mean. 

~ Which of the following is true of the mean?

* For normal distributions, it is approximately equal to the median and mode.

~ Which of the follow is true of the mode?

* It is not affected by extreme score \(outliers\).
* For normal distributions, it is approximately equal to the mean and median. 
* It is the most frequently occurring score. 
* It can be used to describe categorical data, such as gender or country of origin. 

~ Which of the following is true of the median?

* It is the exact middle of any distribution \(half the data is less than the median, half is more\)
* It is nor affected by extreme scores\(outliners\).
* For normal distributions, it is approximately equal to the mean and mode.

**Outilier** &lt; Q1 - 1.5 \(IQR\)

Q3 + 1.5 \(IQR\)

**SS** \(Sum of squares\) = M \(xi - x\)

**Variance** -

* Mean of squared deviations
* Sum of squared deviations divided by n

**Standard deviation** -

* Square root of average squared deviation. 
* Square root of \(\(Sum of square deviations\) divided by n\).

A negative Z-Score means:

* The original value is less than the mean. 
* The original value minus the mean is negative. 

The z-score of any value, that's one standard deviation away from the mean, will then be 1 after we standardize it.

**Standard normal distribution **

When we have a normal distributions, we can standardize it by first subtracting the mean, shifting it to 0. And then dividing by the standard deviation, which makes the standard deviation 1.

Mean - the average

Median - in the middle

Mode - The most common

To find the mean - add up the values in the data set and then divide by the number of values that you added.

To find the median - list the values of the data set in numerical order and and identify which values of the data set in numerical order and identify which value appears in the middle of the list.

To find the mode - identify which value in the data set occurs most often.

#### Conditional Probability -

Of an event B is the probability that the event will occur given the knowledge that an event A has already happen.

**If eventsAandBare not independent, then the probability of theintersection of A and B**\(the probability that both events occur\) is defined by  
P\(A and B\) = P\(A\)P\(B\|A\).

From this definition, the conditional probabilityP\(B\|A\)is easily obtained by dividing byP\(A\):

P\(B/A\) = P \(A and B\) / P\(A\)

BI \(Business Intelligence\) uses Data mining is a process that looks for patterns in data, so in a sense it is like querying the data. The Crucial differences between simply querying the data and data mining can be summed up as intent and scale.
