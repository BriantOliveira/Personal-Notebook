**Constructor Function** - is simply a function that creates an object class and allows you to create multiple instance of that class \(allows to create multiple objects that all have the same properties and same functionality, because they are part of the same class\).

```
Function User(firstName, lastName, age, gender) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age; 
    this.gender = gender;
};
```
