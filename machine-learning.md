## Key machine learning terms and concepts {#key-machine-learning-terms-and-concepts}

Machine learning terms can be confusing. Here are definitions of key terms to help you. Use comments following to tell us about any other term you'd like defined.

### Data exploration, descriptive analytics, and predictive analytics {#data-exploration-descriptive-analytics-and-predictive-analytics}

**Data exploration**is the process of gathering information about a large and often unstructured data set in order to find characteristics for focused analysis.

**Data mining**refers to automated data exploration.

**Descriptive analytics**is the process of analyzing a data set in order to summarize what happened. The vast majority of business analytics - such as sales reports, web metrics, and social networks analysis - are descriptive.

**Predictive analytics**is the process of building models from historical or current data in order to forecast future outcomes.

### Supervised and unsupervised learning {#supervised-and-unsupervised-learning}

**Supervised learning**algorithms are trained with labeled data - in other words, data comprised of examples of the answers wanted. For instance, a model that identifies fraudulent credit card use would be trained from a data set with labeled data points of known fraudulent and valid charges. Most machine learning is supervised.

**Unsupervised learning**is used on data with no labels, and the goal is to find relationships in the data. For instance, you might want to find groupings of customer demographics with similar buying habits.
