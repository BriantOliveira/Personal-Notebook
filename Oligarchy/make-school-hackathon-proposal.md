# MS Hackathon Proposal

---

* **Hackers and Hackathons**

Prior to the negative denotation propagated by the media, a hacker was any person who used code to find a genius/shortcut method of doing or something. Programmers are slowly moving back to the old definition of the term; the hackers at student run hackathons do not break into bank accounts or steal data from websites. These students write code for the betterment of society.

Hackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical backgrounds come together for a period of time, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively code a unique solution from scratch — these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, robots, or some new invention.Hackathons have a vibrant culture and promote an effort to create for good.

Companies like Twitter and GroupMe have come out of hackathons proving their validity and the impact they can have on the world.

* **What is Make School Hacks?**

If approved by the Make School administration, Make School Hacks will be a hackathon at Make School open to high schoolers across the country. This hackathon will be funded entirely by top-level technology business and startups, but will require Make School support and will utilize Make School facilities.

**

**Why host Make School Hacks?**

Hackathons are a relatively untapped idea, hosting one will benefit Make School in a number of ways:

* **Corporation interest and sponsorship**

* **Media interest**

* **University interest**

* **Student interest**

* **Uniquenessfactor**

**    
**

* **Make School is Attainable**

Though generally hosted by universities, hackathons have become more prominent at the high school level. For example, Bergen County Academies hosted its third iteration of hackBCA in April . One of the main reasons why the event has been so successful was due to the fact that it had immense support from the school. Visit HackBCA \(Bergen County Acadmies’ hackathon website\) at [http://hackbca.com/](http://hackbca.com/) for more info.

Another valuable resource, Major League Hacking \(MLH - website at mlh.io\), has been set up for schools looking to host hackathons. MLH aids with several of the event processes, including press coverage, promotion, and the finding of sponsors.

**Make School Hacks Details and Logistics:**

* **Will be hosted by Make School alongside with faculty and students.**

* **Hackers will apply individually.**

* **The goal of the hackathon is to have hackers from all kind of levels, the beginner hackers will arrive on Friday and do a 12 hours course of a variety of technology and different  coding languages. **

* **Saturday the more experient hackers will arrive. There will be a small introduction ceremony to integrate and introduce beginners and experient hackers. **

* **Saturday during the ceremony teams will be introduced to each other. The whole point of hackers registering individually is that the teams will be a mix between beginners and experient hackers. It will be a fun enviroment to introduce people with all kinds of experience and levels. **

* **Ideally the goal is to have funds coming from a small group of sponsors and companies - this allows everything to be free for those participating in the hackathon**

* **100 hackers, 25 volunteers \(divided into two shifts\), 30 mentors from colleges or companies, and an estimated 50 judges or less\(to be discussed\) and sponsors = atotal of approximately 150-170 attendees**

* **Hosted in 2018 and date still have to be discussed. **

* * **Start time \(to be decided\) to end time = 29 hours \(Hackathons are generally overnight events\)**

  * **Total predicted time \(including event set up/clean up\) = ~36 hours**
