Joma takes an STD test and the test is advertised as being 99% accurate: if you have the std you will test positive 99% of the time, and if you don't have the std, you will test negative 99% of the time. If you have 1% of all people have this std and Joma test positive, what is the probability that Joma has the disease?

```
    99% (Probability of this event happening) = 99% (Numbers of ways it can happen)/ 
                                                1%(Total numbers of outcome)
   
   1% x 99%/ 1% x 99% + 1% = 50%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
```
