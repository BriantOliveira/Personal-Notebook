Question 1: Joma takes an STD test and the test is advertised as being 99% accurate: if you have the std you will test positive 99% of the time, and if you don't have the std, you will test negative 99% of the time. If you have 1% of all people have this std and Joma test positive, what is the probability that Joma has the disease?

```
    99% (Probability of this event happening) = 99% (Numbers of ways it can happen)/ 
                                                1%(Total numbers of outcome)

   1% x 99%/ 1% x 99% + 1% = 50% 
```





Question 2: Notvine is a platform where users can share 6.1 looping videos as seen in the startup series and it's basically a feed of content you follow. Now imagine we are considering launching a share button, where can share else video and it will show to your followers. How would you evaluate this change? What metrics do you expect to change? How will you decide to launch it or not?

A: Do an experimental roll out only a few publishers first, and then a/b test it. So for some users they see it and for some they don't see the shared post.  That way we can see consumer behavior.
