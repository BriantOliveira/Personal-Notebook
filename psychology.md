### Chapter 3 

# **Biopsychology **

The study of how biological and physiological system affect behavior and mental process.

**Chapter 3**

**1. What is behavioral neuroscience? Evolutionary Psychology? Natural selection? Why is the phrase “only the strong survive” not descriptive of natural selection? Give an example.**

**Behavioral neuroscience - The field that studies the physiological bases of human and animal behavior and mental process.**

**Evolutionary Psychology - The study of the evolution of behavior through natural selection.**

**2. Differentiate between the three major nervous systems, including the subdivisions and functions of each?**

**CNS \(Central Nervous System\) - Composed by the brain and spinal cord. The brain is important for the psychological functioning. The Spinal cord provides means of communication between the brain and the body.**

**Sympathetic - The division of the autonomic nervous system that arouses the body to prepare it for action.**

**Parasympathetic - The division of the autonomic nervous system that calms the body and performs maintenance functions.**

**3. Be able to label and describe the following parts of neurons: The soma, dendrites, axon, myelin sheath, terminal buttons\(‘synaptic knobs’\).**

**Soma \(or cell body\) - contains the nucleus, which directs the neuron to act as nerve cell rather than as a fat cell, a muscle cell.**

**Dendrites - are short, branching fibers that receive neural impulses.**

**Axon - The part of the neuron that conducts neural impulses to glands, muscles, or other neuron.**

**Myelin sheath - A fatty white substance that forms sheaths around certain axons and increases the speed of neural impulses.**

**Synaptic Transmission - The conveying of a neural impulse between a neuron and a gland, muscle, sensory organ, or another neuron.**

**4. Briefly describe the process of neural \(synaptic\) transmission. Your answer should include the action potential, synapse, and neurotransmitters.**

1. **When a neural impulse reaches the end of an axon, it induces a chemical reaction that makes some synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse.**

2. **The molecules diffuse across the synapse and reach the dendrites of another neuron.**

3. **The molecules attach to tiny areas on the dendrites called receptor sites.**

4. **The molecules interact with the receptor sites to excite the neuron;this slightly depolarize enough to reach its firing threshold, it must be excited by neurotransmitters released by many neurons. To further complicate the process, a neuron also can be affected by neurotransmitters that inhibit it from depolarizing. Thus, a neuron will fire an action potential only when the combined effects of excitatory neurotransmitters sufficiently exceed the combined effects of inhibitory neurotransmitters.**

5. **Neurotransmitters do no remain attached to the receptor sites, continuing to affect them indefinitely. Instead, after the neurotransmitters have done their job, they either are broken down by chemicals called enzymes or taken back into the neurons that released them -- in a process called reuptake.**

**5. What type of behavior /disorders are associated with each of the following neurotransmitters? Acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, endorphins.**

**Alzheimer’s disease & Parkinson’s disease.**

**Acetylcholine - First discovered neurotransmitters. In the peripheral system, it is the neurotransmitter at synapses between the neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system and the organs they control, such as the heart. Also is the neurotransmitter at synapses between motor neurons and muscle fibers, where it stimulates muscle contractions.**

**Dopamine - Gives the ability to perform smooth voluntary movements.**

**Norepinephrine - Our moods vary with the level of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in the brain. A low level is associated with depression.**

**Endorphins - Neurotransmitter that play a role in pleasure, pain relief, and other functions.**

**6. What is a hormone? What is the chief difference between hormones and neurotransmitters?**

**At heart, the distinction between neurotransmitters and hormones is how they are transmitted - not necessarily a difference in the chemicals themselves.**

**Neurotransmitters are sent over synapses, between neurons. They may be small molecules \(e.g.**[**dopamine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine)**\) or larger molecules such as proteins \(e.g.**[**substance P**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_P)**\). Conversely, hormones are sent through the circulatory system but could also be small molecules \(e.g.**[**adrenaline**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline)**\) or large molecules \(e.g.**[**growth hormone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone)**\).**

**Looking at the structures of these chemicals, we can see that both neurotransmitters and hormones have an enormous variability in the chemicals they involve. Furthermore, dopamine looks much closer to adrenaline than it does to substance P. But dopamine is primarily a neurotransmitter and adrenaline is typically thought of as a hormone!**

**There may also be overlap between roles of chemicals as neurotransmitters or hormones. In fact, adrenaline may act as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone. So, to answer your question of "why do some neurotransmitters act as hormones?" - the distinction is in the context of how the chemical is sent through the body. There's variability in which chemicals are used for either purpose, and no rule saying a chemical can't be sent via multiple mechanisms.**

**Furthermore, neurotransmission also involves spillover of neurotransmitter, which in theory could find its way into the circulatory system. So there could be overlap between neurotransmission and hormone signaling.**

**7. What is phrenology? Why did it develop? What methods have been used to obtain TRUE information about the brain and behavior?**

**The study of the conformation of the skull as indicative of mental faculties and traits of character. A discredited technique for determining intellectual abilities and personality traits by examining the bumps and depressions of the skull.**

1. **The brain is the organ of the mind;**

2. **Human mental powers can be analyzed into a definite number of independent faculties;**

3. **These faculties are innate, and each has its seat in a definite region of the surface of the brain;**

4. **The size of each such constituent element in the degree to which the faculty seated in it forms a constituent element in the character of the individual;**

5. **The correspondence between the outer surface of the skull and the contour of the brain-surface beneath is sufficiently close to enable the observe to recognize the relative sizes of these several organs by the examination of the outer surface of the head.**

**8. Be familiar with a function of each of the following: frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe.**

**Frontal lobe - A lobe of the cerebral cortex responsible for motor control and higher mental processes.**

**Parietal lobe - responsible for processing bodily sensations and perceiving spatial relations.**

**Temporal lobe - Responsible for processing hearing.**

**Occipital lobe - Responsible for processing vision.**

**9. Be familiar with a function of each of the following brain structures -- thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, medulla, cerebellum.**

**Thalamus - capping the brain stem is the egg-shaped thalamus. The thalamus functions as sensory relay station, sending taste, bodily, visual and auditory sensations on the other areas of the brain for further processing.**

**Medulla - Of all the brain stem structures, which connects the brain and spinal cord.**

**Hypothalamus - helps regulate numerous functions, including eating, drinking, emotion, sexual behavior, blood pressure, and body temperature.**

**Amygdala - Is deep within the temporal lobe and responds to strong emotional situations and feelings.**

**10. What is plasticity of the brain? Give examples of evidence which supports the notion that plasticity of the brain exists.**

**The brain’s ability to learn from experience and to promote adaptive behavior.**

**11. What are some of the specialized functions of the two brain hemispheres? How do we know that these specialized functions exist?**

**Right Hemisphere - Superior at perceiving spatial relations. You would be able to perform a block-design task equally well with either your right and your left hand because your intact corpus callosum would let information from your spatially superior right hemisphere help your left hemisphere control your right hand.**
