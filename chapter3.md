# Probability

**Pragmatic: A measure of the likelihood of an event. Theoretical: A formal system to quantify uncertainty.**

#### Rules of Probability 

A and B are events of uncertain occurrence 

Probability theory assumes these axioms:

0 &lt; P\(A\) &lt; 1

P\(TRUE\) = 1 and P\(FALSE\) = 0 

* **Discrete probability** means working with **Int**

* **Uniform distribution**: A known finite number of outcomes are equally likely to occur. 

* Distinguish between **tokens** and** types**:

               **Token** ~ occurrences of words **\(object are tokens\)**

                **Types** ~ distinct words **\(classes are types\)**
