### Approaches to Study the brain

* Experiment - observe

  * Normal brain - genes to behavior 
  * Diseased brain - toxin, drugs, lesions, mutations, degeneration

* Theory - hypothesize

  * Informatics - trends, correlations and patterns in data.

  * Theoretical neuroscience - explain data, predicts outcomes

  * Computational Neuroscience - minimal models that fits specific experimental data.

  * Applied neuroscience - use it in medicine and engineering.

* Simulation - unify

  * Consider every detail of the brain

  * Integrate data according to current knowledge

  * Fill gaps using hypotheses
