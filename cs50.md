##### C Programming 

C as a programming language have a main piece of code that gets executed by default.  

```
#include  <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world\n");
}
```

And it's a special function that exist  in C that when you run a program, it is main that gets run by default. But in order to do that, we unfortunately need to take something that is already cryptic to us humans... We first need to translate the code that we write into machine code. At the end of the day machine only understands zeros and ones. But it turns out, these patterns of zeros and ones just have a special meaning. In certain contexts, they might mean numbers. In some contexts, they might mean letters, or colors, or any number of other abstraction there upon. 

Well, Intel CPUs \(central processing units\)  and other simply have decided in advance that certain patterns of zeros and one shall mean specific things. Certain patterns of zeros and ones will mean, print this to the screen, or add these two numbers, or subtract these two numbers, or add these two numbers, or subtract these two numbers, or move this piece of data from my computer's memory over here, or any number of other very low level, but ultimately useful, operations. 

Compiled is converted from source code to machine code. 

```
clang hello.c
```

Clang is a compiler that is pre-installed.
