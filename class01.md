### Why should I write a test?

Testing is something that a lot of engineering teams take very seriously from day one and as result, it's a big part of a work environment and development culture. If you haven't done testing before it's ok, hopefully by the end of this tutorial you will become a wizard when it comes to testing.

Testing your code will save you and your team a lot of time, it will make your development experience much easier and work happier by writing unit tests.  Writing test is one of the best ways to get on board with a larger code base. 

### Different types of software testing?

There is two types of testing which are Functional and Non-functional test. A few of the most common functional test are:

* Unit testing, Integration testing
* System testing
* Interface testing, and others.

 A few common Non-functional tests are:

*  Performance test
* Stress testing
* Load testing
* Reliability testing, and others. 

During this tutorial we will talk about three very important tests.

1. Unit Test.
2. End-to-end Test.
3. Harness Test.

### What is Unit Testing? 

One of the smallest parts of your application is called units, testing these units to check whether is a fit for use or not is called unit testing. 

If you are going to create a test  for a given function or component of your code, then we need to make sure that the function or component by itself, separate from everything else, is doing what it is intended to do, no more, not less and mock rest of things which are not under test.

### What is End-to-end Testing?
